              <li><strong><u>Thread Body</u></strong>: The midweight Salomon Quest 4D II GTX is the winner of our Editors' Choice Award, conquering pretty much any trail or terrain we traveled. Great comfort, excellent traction on wet or dry terrain, and superior water resistance (while still being breathable!) set it apart. When we had to pick one model for variable terrain and weather, we chose this one without a second thought. Its excellent support system kept our feet and ankles stable as we covered ground quickly. We loved the combination of aggressive performance at a reasonable weight. The innovative technology and construction found in the Quest 4D II make this model comfortable for hours and hours, whether on a short day hike or pounding miles on an extended backpacking trip. What's more, it's even suitable for snowshoeing. What's not to love?</li>

              <li><strong><u>Thread Body</u></strong>: Easily attained glory in the North Cascades! Cedar Falls is a two-tiered cascade that crashes loudly for much of the summer. The hike climbs gently to the falls at 1.75 miles while the creek below rages downstream loudly. While mostly in the trees, there are views of Goat Peak and pretty wildflowers to enjoy. For those wanting further exploration, an additional 7 miles will take you to the fabulous vistas from Abernathy Ridge.</li>

              <li><strong><u>Thread Body</u></strong>: Start out from the main parking lot, pass the bulletin boards and the convenient toilets, and then note the small trail sign directing you to the right to find the Swamp Trail. You will come to the actual beginning of the trail in about 100 yards where a big sign greets you (see photo). Additional signs along the way tell the story of Zoe's visit there, and her encounters with various wetland critters (Zoe might herself be a critter...) and their uneasiness about a possibly-mythical Swamp Monster. A brochure often is available at the trailhead, and it offers supplementary material for accompanying adults to enhance the visit. The surroundings are very green, with lots of moss and ferns but you won't see much standing water and definitely no alligators! If you're just out for a short walk, then hike the Swamp Trail a half mile and, when it meets the Gas Line and a Power Line, turn around there. By then you will have read all of Zoe's story, so you can just head back to your trailhead.</li>
